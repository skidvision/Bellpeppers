# Shapes for vision and haptic experiments
##### v 1.1

The following objects were scanned from the original casts used in Norman et al. (2004). We used a [NextEngine](https://www.nextengine.com) laser scanner to obtain high-resolution scans of these objects. The resulting files were cleaned and optimized using software written using [Wolfram Mathematica](http://wolfram.com) and prepared for 3D printing with Autodesk [Meshmixer](http://www.meshmixer.com).

We are making the scan data available here, for research use by the research community. Please cite our dataset —
